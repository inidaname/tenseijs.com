description: The media plugin for Tensei. How to handle file uploads
---

When building production-ready applications, efficiently handling file uploads is critical. Tensei provides a plugin to abstract this functionality for you.

This plugin provides a file upload REST API endpoint and GraphQL query, and a way to associate file uploads to any application resources.

To install this plugin, run the following command:

```bash
yarn add @tensei/media

# Or using npm
npm install --save @tensei/media
```

## Register plugin
Once installed, you may register this plugin with your tensei application using the `.plugins()` method on the Tensei instance:

```js
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')
const { media } = require('@tensei/media')

tensei()
    .plugins([
        media()
            .plugin()
    ])
```

## Add media to resources
Once you register the media plugin, you may need to associate existing resources to your application to uploaded files. To do this, the media plugin exports a `file()` and `files()` field. These fields create a `hasOne()` and `hasMany()` relationship between the resource and the media plugin resource respectively.

Since Mikro ORM does not support polymorphic relationships at the moment, the media plugin uses a Single-Table Inheritance approach to associating resources with file uploads.

Let's take an example social networking application. We want users to have multiple profile pictures, and a single avatar:

```js
const { media, files, file } = require('@tensei/media')
const { tensei, resource, text } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .resources([
        resource('User')
            .fields([
                text('Full Name'),
                file('Avatar'),
                files('Profile Pictures'),
            ])
    ])
    .plugins([
        media()
            .plugin()
    ])
```

## Uploading files
You may upload files to the REST or GraphQL APIs. Here's an example on how to upload files using Axios to the Rest API:

```js
import Axios from 'axios'

async function upload(event) {
    const { files } = event.target

    const form = new FormData()

    files.forEach(file => form.append('files', file))

    Axios.post('http://localhost:8810/files', form, {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'
        }
    }).then((uploaded_files) => {
        // console.log(uploaded_files)
    })
}
```

The data returned from the API would contain `File` instances, with all information about the uploaded files. Here's sample data from a file upload:

```js
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 6,
            "size": 24765,
            "original_filename": "avatar.jpeg",
            "extension": "jpeg",
            "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
            "hash": "c8b0019021cfbc19b44e0cffb56296115ca0b387dca19de9b64db1b420d933e2bb632af1",
            "path": "/",
            "disk": "local",
            "transformations": []
        },
        {
            "id": 7,
            "size": 16685,
            "original_filename": "4X4.JPG",
            "extension": "JPG",
            "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
            "hash": "724cca2d3a8a1d040ccd92a05b16b7bcacd497dd00231467e5984bf8aca15b6a78cc7f63",
            "path": "/",
            "disk": "local",
            "transformations": []
        }
    ]
}
```

After uploading files, you may now associate model instances with the ID of the returned file instances. For example, you may make a PATCH request to update a user's profile with the uploaded files:

```js
PATCH /api/users/1?populate=avatar,profile_pictures HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5000
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"avatar": 5, // ID of uploaded file
	"profile_pictures": [6, 7] // ID of uploaded files
}
```

## What is Tensei?
Tensei is an elegant, open-source headless CMS that makes it very fast and easy to build powerful and secure APIs.
Out of the box, you can setup a fully customisable GraphQL or Rest API with `email/password` and `social` authentication, JWT, access and refresh tokens, Role Based Access Control (`RBAC`) and a beautiful, fully customisable headless CMS dashboard to manage your content seamlessly.

Tensei supports `Mysql`, `MongoDB`, `Sqlite` and `Postgresql`. Database communication is implemented using the amazing [Mikro ORM](https://mikro-orm.io/), a fast and secure ORM for Node.js.

## Requirements
Before we setup your first project, make sure you have a basic development environment setup, with the following tools installed on your system:

<List>
  <ListItemGood><a href='https://nodejs.org'>Node.js</a> >= v12, preferrably an LTS version</ListItemGood>
  <ListItemGood>
    <a href='https://yarnpkg.com'>Yarn</a> or <a href='https://npmjs.com'>npm</a> package manager
  </ListItemGood>
</List>

## Setup a new Tensei project
Let's build a simple blogging application. You can generate a project using a single command:

```bash
yarn create tensei-app blogging-app

# Or using npm
npx create-tensei-app blogging-app
```

This will generate a new project in a folder called `blogging-app` with GraphQL and authentication already setup for you. If you prefer a REST API, add the `--rest` parameter to the create command.

Tensei requires very little code to run, so you'll see only three files in the generated project: `.gitignore`, `package.json` and `index.js` file.

The `index.js` file contains your server, and the content should look like this:

```javascript
const { cms } = require('@tensei/cms')
const { auth } = require('@tensei/auth')
const { media } = require('@tensei/media')
const { graphql } = require('@tensei/graphql')
const { tensei, welcome } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .root(__dirname)
    .plugins([
        welcome(),
        cms().plugin(),
        media().graphql().plugin(),
        auth().plugin(),
        graphql().plugin()
    ])
    .start()
    .catch(console.error)
```

- The `tensei()` method creates a new tensei app
- The `plugins()` method registers plugins to your application. Each plugin is delegated to a specific task. This means you can remove plugins you do not need from your application easily.
  - `.cms()` registers the CMS dashboard.
  - `.media()` adds a simple media manager to the CMS for file uploads.
  - `.auth()` adds different authentication strategies to the application.
  - `.graphql()` adds a graphql API to the tensei app.
  - `.welcome()` adds the beautiful welcome screen to the `/` route.
- The `.start()` method starts the server on port `8810`.

Run the server with `yarn dev`. You should see the following message:

```bash
INFO    : ðŸš€ Access your server on http://localhost:8810
INFO    : ðŸ“‰ Access your graphql playground on http://localhost:8810/graphql
INFO    : ðŸ¦„ Access your cms dashboard http://localhost:8810/cms
```

## Introduction to CMS
The CMS uses passwordless authentication. Visit the CMS dashboard and type in an email for the first administrator user. Once you do, an email will be sent with a magic login link.

![register admin tensei cms](https://res.cloudinary.com/bahdcoder/image/upload/v1612605726/register-admin-tensei-cms_gr0yu9.png)

Tensei supports multiple mail drivers, including `console.log`. The sent email is logged to your terminal with the magic link. CLick on it to login to the dashboard.

![email html in terminal](https://res.cloudinary.com/bahdcoder/image/upload/v1612606044/email-magic-link-in-terminal_d91m2o.png)

In the terminal you can locate the `<a href="..."></a>` and `Cmd + Click` on it to open it in the browser.

## Resources
For a blog, we'll need some resources such as `Post`, `Comment`, `Category` and `Author`. To define a resource, we may use the `resource` function from the `@tensei/core` package. Let's create the `Post` resource:

```javascript
...
const { tensei, resource } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
  .root(__dirname)
  .resources([
    resource('Post'),
  ])
  ...
```



## Fields
A Post resource would need fields such as a title, description, and content. Each resource represents a database table. By default, the resource would have `ID`, `Created At` and `Updated At` fields. We need to add more fields to each registered resource. For example, the `Post` resource needs a `Title`, `Slug`, `Description`, `Content`, and `Published At`. Fields of different types are shipped with Tensei by default.

```js
const { text, textarea, dateTime, slug } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Post')
  .fields([
      text('Title'),
      slug('Slug').from('Title'),
      textarea('Description'),
      textarea('Content'),
      dateTime('Published At'),
  ])
```

- The `text()` field creates a text field in the CMS and API.
- The `slug()` field creates a slug field from the `Title`. As you type in the Title field, it'll generate the slug dynamically. That's how powerful fields can be.
- The `textarea()` field creates a larger text field. On the CMS, it'll show up as a textarea.
- The `dateTime()` field creates a dateTime field and will show up as a date-time picker on the CMS.

Now save your changes, and visit the CMS dashboard. On the left sidebar, the `Posts` nav item should show up. The index view shows all the posts in the database. Now we have none yet. Click the `Add Post` button. This shows the `form` view, which you may use to insert a new Post.

![add new post on tensei cms](https://res.cloudinary.com/bahdcoder/image/upload/v1612610125/Screenshot_2021-02-06_at_12.14.59_rezyar.png)

Create a new Post. After creating, you're redirected to the index view. You should now have one post on the table. You may click the `eye` icon or the `ID` to view the details of the Post.

Let's add the `Category` resource to our blog.

```js
const { text, textarea } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Category')
  .fields([
      text('Name'),
      textarea('Description'),
  ])
```

Create a new category and save. We should now have 1 post and 1 category on our dashboard.

## Relationships
In our blog, we need to link posts to a category. To do this, we must establish a one to many relationship using the `hasMany` and `belongsTo fields from tensei.
We'll add the `hasMany` field to the category resource:

```js
const { text, textarea, hasMany } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Category')
  .fields([
      text('Name'),
      textarea('Description'),
      hasMany('Post')
  ])
```

Finally we'll add the `belongsTo` field to the post resource:

```js
const { text, textarea, dateTime, slug, belongsTo } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Post')
  .fields([
      text('Title'),
      slug('Slug').from('Title'),
      textarea('Description'),
      textarea('Content'),
      dateTime('Published At'),
      belongsTo('Category')
  ])
```

Save your changes and refresh the cms page in the browser.Now visit the Post you created before. Notice there is a new field on the right side for Category. We may now select a category to associate with this post. 

![edit post with category](https://res.cloudinary.com/bahdcoder/image/upload/v1612611257/edit-post-category_mxivij.png)

Save the changes. Now click the ID of the post to view its details. Notice there's a new Category field now showing a link to the associated category.

![view post with category](https://res.cloudinary.com/bahdcoder/image/upload/v1612611496/view-post-with-category_xks42t.png)

If you click that link, it should take you directly to the view category page. You should now see a list of posts below the category, showing all posts associated with this category:

![category view with post](https://res.cloudinary.com/bahdcoder/image/upload/v1612611647/category-view-with-posts_ajjuoj.png)

## GraphQL API
We may also perform CRUD operations on our data using the GraphQL API. The following queries are generated for the resources we have now:

```graphql
type post {
  id: ID!
  created_at: String
  updated_at: String
  title: String
  slug: String
  description: String
  content: String
  published_at: String
  category: category
}

post(id: ID!): post
posts__count(offset: Int, limit: Int, where: post_where_query): Int!
posts(offset: Int, limit: Int, where: post_where_query, order_by: post_query_order): [post]
```

- The `post` query fetches a single post by ID
- The `posts` query fetches, orders, paginates and filters all posts
- The `posts__count` query fetches, orders, filters all posts, and returns the count.

Visit the GraphQL Playground at `http://localhost:8810/graphql` and try the queries out like this:

![post queries](https://res.cloudinary.com/bahdcoder/image/upload/v1612612641/Screenshot_2021-02-06_at_12.56.27_m2omgd.png)

Mutations for creating, updating and deleting posts are also generated automatically for you:

```graphql
insert_post(object: insert_post_input!): post!
insert_posts(objects: [insert_post_input]!): [post]!

update_post(id: ID!, object: update_post_input!): post!
update_posts(where: post_where_query!, object: update_post_input!): [post]!

delete_post(id: ID!): post
delete_posts(where: post_where_query): [post]
```

Here's how you would create new a post using the `insert_post` mutation:

## Final Code

Here's the final 30 lines of code for our fully-featured blog with a CMS and CRUD GraphQL API:

```js
const { cms } = require('@tensei/cms')
const { auth } = require('@tensei/auth')
const { media } = require('@tensei/media')
const { graphql } = require('@tensei/graphql')
const { tensei, welcome, resource, text, textarea, dateTime, slug, hasMany, belongsTo } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .root(__dirname)
    .resources([
        resource('Post')
            .fields([
                text('Title'),
                slug('Slug').from('Title'),
                textarea('Description'),
                textarea('Content'),
                dateTime('Published At'),
                belongsTo('Category')
            ]),
            resource('Category')
                .fields([
                    text('Name'),
                    textarea('Description'),
                    hasMany('Post')
                ])
    ])
    .plugins([
        welcome(),
        cms().plugin(),
        media().plugin(),
        auth().plugin(),
        graphql().plugin()
    ])
    .start()
    .catch(console.error)
```

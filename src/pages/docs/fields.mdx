description: Customise Tensei resources with fields
---

A field represents a database column.

Each Tensei resource has a `fields` method. This method takes in an array of fields that define the columns on the table this resource maps to.

Fields are much more than just columns. They can represent any way of collecting data from the user. Tensei ships with a variety of fields out of the box, including fields for text inputs, booleans, dates, file uploads, Markdown, Wysiwyg editors, Rich editors and more.

## Defining Fields
To create a field, first you need to identify the type of data this field would be storing. Let's take a `Post` resource for example. A Post might have a `Title` field and a `Published` field. The title field would be a `varchar` column, and the `published` field would be a `boolean` column.

If you're using a NoSQL database, the title would be a `String` field, and  published would be a `Boolean` field.

```js
const { tensei, resource, text, boolean } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .resources([
        resource('Post')
            .fields([
                text('Title'),
                boolean('Published')
            ])
    ])
```

### Field Column Conventions

Tensei will "snake case" the name of the field to determine the underlying database column. For example, the `text('Example Title')` field would connect to the `example_title` column. However, if necessary, you may pass the column name as the second argument to the field's method:

```javascript
text('Title', 'custom_title_column')
```

## Showing / Hiding Fields on dashboard

As mentioned above, the defined fields would not only be used to determine the database columns, but also the types of input components to display on the dashboard.

Often, you will only want to display a field in certain situations. For example, there is typically no need to show a `Password` field on a resource index listing. Likewise, you may wish to only display a `Created At` field on the creation / update forms. Tensei makes it a breeze to hide / show fields on certain screens.

The following methods may be used to show / hide fields based on the display context:

- `showOnIndex`
- `showOnDetail`
- `showOnCreate`
- `showOnUpdate`
- `hideOnIndex`
- `hideOnDetail`
- `hideOnCreate`
- `hideOnUpdate`
- `onlyOnForms`
- `exceptOnForms`

You may chain any of these methods onto your field's definition in order to instruct Tensei where the field should be displayed:

```javascript
resource('Post')
    .fields([
        text('Title')
            .hideOnIndex()
            .hideOnUpdate()
    ])
```

The Title field would be hidden from the resource index table because we called `hideOnIndex()`, and will be hidden when updating a `Post` because we called `hideOnUpdate()`.

## Showing / Hiding fields from API
Sometimes you want to completely prevent a field from being exposed to the API. You may use a combination of these methods to control where fields show up in the API:

- `hideFromCreateApi()`
- `hideFromUpdateApi()`
- `hideFromDeleteApi()`
- `hideFromFetchApi()`
- `hideFromShowApi()`

Let's say you want to prevent a secret token field from being exposed to all data fetching endpoints, but be exposed to the create and update endpoints:

```javascript
text('Secret')
    .hideFromFetchApi()
    .hideFromShowApi()
```

You may also use the `hideFromApi()` method to completely hide a field from showing up in any calls to the API.

## Sortable Fields

When attaching a field to a resource, you may use the `sortable` method to indicate that the resource index may be sorted by the given field:

```js
resource('Post')
    .fields([
        text('Title')
            .sortable()
    ])
```

## Searchable Fields

You may use the `searchable` method to indicate that this field can be searched. When the search box on the resource index is used, only the searchable fields would be queried. All searchable fields would also be indexed in the database.

```js
resource('Post')
    .fields([
        text('Title')
            .searchable()
    ])
```

## Field Types

This portion of the documentation only discusses non-relationship fields. To learn more about relationship fields, [check out their documentation](/docs/relationships).

Tensei ships with a variety of field types. So, let's explore all of the available types and their options:

- [Boolean](#boolean-field)
- [Date](#date-field)
- [DateTime](#date-time-field)
- [Timestamp](#timestamp-field)
- [Integer](#integer-field)
- [Big Integer](#big-integer-field)
- [Double](#double-field)
- [Float](#float-field)
- [Select](#select-field)
- [Text](#text-field)
- [Slug](#slug-field)
- [Textarea](#textarea-field)

### Boolean Field

The `Boolean` field may be used to represent a boolean / "tiny integer" column in your database. For example, assuming your database has a boolean column named `active`, you may attach a `Boolean` field to your resource like so:

```js
const { resource, boolean } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Customer')
    .fields([
        boolean('Active')
    ])
```

A `Boolean` field would show up as a checkbox on dashboard forms.

### Date Field

The `Date` field may be used to store a date value (without time).

```js
const { resource, date } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Employee')
    .fields([
        date('Birthday')
    ])
```

#### Default date time
You can default this field to the current time using `.defaultToNow()` method. If a default value is not defined when creating a resource, this value would default to the current date.

```js
date('Birthday')
    .defaultToNow()
```

#### Date Formats

You may customize the display format of your `Date` fields using the `format` method. This format won't affect how the date is saved to the database. The format must be a format supported by [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/parse/string-format):

```js
date('Birthday')
    .format('do MMM yyyy, hh:mm a'),
```

### DateTime Field

The `DateTime` field may be used to store a date-time value. It will also show a date/time picker on dashboard forms.

```js
const { resource, dateTime } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Employee')
    .fields([
        dateTime('Started On')
    ])
```

You may customize the display format of your `DateTime` fields using the `format` method. This format won't affect how the date is saved to the database. The format must be a format supported by [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/parse/string-format):

```js
dateTime('Started On')
    .format('do MMM yyyy, hh:mm a'),
```

### Timestamp Field

The `Timestamp` field may be used to store a timestamp value. It will also show a date/time picker on dashboard forms.

```js
const { resource, timestamp } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Employee')
    .fields([
        timestamp('Last Logged In At')
    ])
```

Just like the date and datetime fields, you can format timestamps for the dashboard using the `.format()` method.

### Integer Field

The `Integer` field provides an `input` control with a `type` attribute of `number`:

```js
const { resource, integer } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Book')
    .fields([
        integer('Price')
    ])
```


You may use the `min`, `max`, and `step` methods to set their corresponding attributes on the generated `input` control. This also applies to other number types such as `bigInteger`, `float`, and `double`.

```js
integer('Price').min(1).max(1000).step(0.01)
```


### Big Integer Field

The `bigInteger` field provides an `input` control with a `type` attribute of `number`. It will also store the data in a `bigInt` database column. It defaults to a number column if the database being used does not support bigint.

```js
const { resource, bigInteger } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Book')
    .fields([
        bigInteger('Price')
    ])
```

### Double Field

The `double` field provides an `input` control with a `type` attribute of `number`. It will also store the data in a `double` database column.

```js
const { resource, double } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Book')
    .fields([
        double('Price')
    ])
```

### Float Field

The `float` field provides an `input` control with a `type` attribute of `number`. It will also store the data in a `float` database column.

```js
const { resource, float } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Book')
    .fields([
        float('Price')
    ])
```

### Select Field

The `Select` field may be used to generate a drop-down select menu. The select menu's options may be defined using the `options` method:

```js
const { select } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Book')
    .fields([
        select('Category')
            .options([{
                label: 'Postgresql',
                value: 'pg'
            }, {
                label: 'SQL database',
                value: 'sql'
            }])
    ])
```

### Text Field

The `Text` field provides an `input` control with a `type` attribute of `text`:

```js
const { text } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Book')
    .fields([
        text('Title')    
    ])
```

Text fields may be customized further by setting any attribute on the field. This can be done by calling the `htmlAttributes` method:

```js
text('Title')
    .htmlAttributes({
        placeholder: 'Enter your email'
    })
```

## Slug Field
The `Slug` field provides a read-only input control that automatically generates a url-friendly slug based on another field.

```js
slug('Slug')
    .from('Title')
    .type('date')
```

The above slug would be automatically generated `from()` the `Title` field. As you type the title on the CMS, you should see this change reflect.

You may call the `.editable()` method if you do not want to slug to be read-only. You'll be able to update it to whatever you need.

### Textarea Field

The `Textarea` field provides a `textarea` control:

```js
const { textarea } = require('@tensei/core')

resource('Book')
    .fields([
        textarea('Description')    
    ])
```

By default, Textarea fields will not display their content when viewing a resource on its detail page. It will be hidden behind a "Show Content" link, that when clicked will reveal the content. You may specify the Textarea field should always display its content by calling the `alwaysShow` method on the field itself:

```js
textarea('Description').alwaysShow()
```

You may also specify the textarea's height by calling the `rows` method on the field:

```js
textarea('Description').rows(7)
```

Textarea fields may be customized further by setting any attribute on the field. This can be done by calling the `htmlAttributes` method:

```php
textarea('Description').htmlAttributes({
    placeholder: 'Some description of this book ...'
})
```

## Customization

### Nullable Fields

If you want to add a not nullable constraint on a column, use the `.notNullable()` method:

```js
text('Title').notNullable()
```

If you want the opposite, you may call the `.nullable()` method to make a field nullable.

### Unique fields

Sometimes you want to add a unique constraint to a database field. You may do so by calling the `.unique()` method on the field:

```js
text('Email')
    .unique()
```

### Default value

To set a database default value for a field, you may use the `.default()` method. 

```js
bigInt('Views')
    .default(1000)
```

If you want to set the default to a database function such as `current_timestamp`, use the `.defaultRaw()` method instead:

```js
timestamp('Expires At')
    .defaultRaw('current_timestamp(3)')
```

### Field Help Text

If you would like to place "help" text beneath a field on the create / update form, you may use the `description` method. This description will also show up on API documentation.

```js
text('Description').description('Provide a clear description of this book.')
```

### Modify on create

You can modify a field before it is inserted into the database. An example use case is hashing a password. You can pass a callback to the `.onCreate()` method that returns the modified value of the field.

```javascript
text('Password')
    .onCreate((user) => Bcrypt.hashSync(user.password))
```

### Modify on update

You can modify a field value before an update query is made to the database. An example use case is an `updated_at` timestamp. We may want this to update to the current date everytime the database row is updated.

```javascript
field('Updated At')
    .onUpdate((user) => new Date())
```

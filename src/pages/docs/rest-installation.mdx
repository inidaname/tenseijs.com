description: How to install and start using the Tensei REST API plugin 
---

## Installation
Tensei has first class support for REST APIs, with really smart features to ensure efficient and performant data loading. To get a fully featured and highly customisable REST API, you need to install the `@tensei/rest` package. It is shipped externally alongside the `@tensei/graphql` package.


If you're generating a Tensei project using `create-tensei-app`, you may create an application with a Rest API by passing the `--rest` option.

```bash
yarn create tensei-app commerce --rest

# Or using npm
npx create-tensei-app commerce --rest
```

If you're adding to an already existing project, you may use the following command to install the plugin:

```bash
yarn add @tensei/rest

# Or using npm
npm install --save @tensei/rest
```

## Register REST plugin
Once installed, require the plugin and add it to the `.plugins([])` array on the tensei instance:

```js
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')
const { rest } = require('@tensei/graphql')

tensei()
    .resources([...])
    .plugins([
        rest().plugin()
    ])
    .start()
```

That's all you need. Configure some resources for your application, and start the node server. By default, all API routes should be available at `/api`. 

## Custom API Path
If you want to prefix the API routes with a different base path from the default `/api`, you may use the `.basePath()` method on the plugin instance:

```js
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')
const { rest } = require('@tensei/graphql')

tensei()
    .resources([...])
    .plugins([
        rest()
            .basePath('backend')
            .plugin()
    ])
    .start()
```
